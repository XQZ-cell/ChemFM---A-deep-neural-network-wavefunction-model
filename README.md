# ChemFM---A-deep-neural-network-wavefunction-model
A DEMO platform for neural network wavefunction models in quantum chemistry, using variational Monte Carlo (VMC)  for training and inference to compute ground-state energy of molecular systems.

Our ultimate goal is to build a pretrained foundational wavefunction model on diverse molecular structures, which can be fine-tuned to previously unseen molecules to accurately predict molecular ground-state energy.
