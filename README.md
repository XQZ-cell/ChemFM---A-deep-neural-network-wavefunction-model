This is a DEMO platform for training a deep neural network wavefunction model using variational Monte Carlo(VMC). By providing the model with molecular structures,
the electronic configurations are automatically generated by Monte Carlo sampling, and estimate molecular ground-state energy. Our goal is to develop a platform 
for pretraining a foundation wavefunction model on diverse molecules, which can be fine-tuned to give accurate prediction of molecules unseen before.

Current version includes the following functions
 - Deploy and train a wavefunction mode on multiple devices;
 - Strandard Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) algorithms;
 - Hartree-Fock pretraining;
 - Inference to predicte ground-state energy of molecules.
